# UI/UX Task 1 – Landing Page Redesign (MakeMyTrip)

This project is part of my UI/UX learning journey, where I was assigned to *redesign an existing landing page*.  
I chose *MakeMyTrip*, a popular travel booking platform, and redesigned the landing page with a fresh, modern, and user-friendly interface.


## 🎯 Objective
- Understand the structure of a real-world landing page  
- Improve visual hierarchy and user flow  
- Apply clean UI/UX principles  
- Create a more intuitive and engaging design
